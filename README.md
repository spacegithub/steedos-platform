## Click, Not Code

Traditional programming, denotes the means of programming by using certain coding languages, to tell a computer exactly how to perform an action.Â 

On the other hand, declarative programming accomplishes the same results by basically telling the computer the end result and letting the computer figure out how to get there.

Steedos is such an declarative programmingÂ platform.Â  Steedos empowers business owners with all of the tools of a developer, without requiring an advanced skill set.

With drag-and-drop simplicity, just about anyone can create apps that automate business processes. The apps you create for your business can be deployed on mobile, tablet and web, be simple or complex, and connect to nearly any data source.

## Based on Metadata

Metadata is core to the steedos infrastructure. Metadata relates to the objects, fields, configurations, code, logic, and page layouts that go into building the information architecture and look and feel of your steedos apps.

There are several types of Metadata, with each one representing a unique way a business function can be customized. Here are a few broad categories for Metadata types:

- **Data**: the core components of the data structure on which most customization is built. E.g. Custom Objects, Fields, and Custom Apps.
- **Programmability**: custom code developed on top of the platform. E.g. Buttons, Form Events, Triggers.
- **Presentation**: customization on how users interact with the platform. E.g. Components, List View and Page Layouts.

## Supported Metadata Types

- **Custom Objects**: Create custom objects to store information thatâ€™s unique to your organization. Choose whether your custom objects are searchable, support sharing, or include access to the Bulk API and Streaming API.

- **Formula**: A formula is an algorithm that derives its value from other fields, expressions, or values. Formulas can help you automatically calculate the value of a field based on other fields.

- **Validation Rules**: Improve the quality of your data using validation rules. Validation rules verify that the data a user enters in a record meets the standards you specify before the user can save the record. 

- **Workflow Rules**: Workflow lets you automate standard internal procedures and processes to save time across your org. A workflow rule is the main container for a set of workflow instructions. These instructions can always be summed up in an if/then statement.

- **Automated Actions**: An automated action is a reusable component that performs some sort of action behind the scenesâ€”like updating a field or sending an email. Once you create an automated action, add it to a process, milestone, or other automated process.

- **Approval Process**:  Different from process automation in the form of workflow rules. Approvals take automation one step further, letting you specify a sequence of steps that are required to approve a record.

- **Report & Dashboard**: Steedos offers a powerful suite of reporting tools that work together to help you understand and act on your data.

## Installation

Steedos is essentially a set of npm packages that can be installed over npm. 

The easiest way to install Steedos is to use the command line tool that helps you create a template project. You can run this command anywhere in a new empty repository or within an existing repository, it will create a new directory containing the scaffolded files.

```bash
npx create-steedos-app my-app
cd my-app
yarn
yarn start
```

## Steedos DX

With Steedos DX, metadata can be imported into Steedos, modified in the product interface, and synchronize back to project source code. 

Steedos DX introduces a new way to organize your metadata and distribute your apps. You can benefit from modern collaboration technologies such as Git to version control everything across your team - your code, your org configuration, and your metadata. 

To make this possible, we're enabling you to export your metadata, define data import files, and easily specify the edition, features, and configuration options of your development, staging, and production environments.
